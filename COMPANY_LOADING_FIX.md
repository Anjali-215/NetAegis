# Company Loading Issue Fix

## Problem
The company indicator was showing "Company: Loading..." for users, especially when there was only one user in the list. This happened because the company was being retrieved from the users list, which might not be immediately available or properly populated.

## Root Cause
The company indicator was using `users[0].company` which:
1. Might not be available immediately when the component loads
2. Could be undefined if the user object doesn't have the company field
3. Was dependent on the users list being populated first

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Current User Company State
```jsx
const [currentUserCompany, setCurrentUserCompany] = useState('');
```

### 2. Created Function to Get Current User's Company
```jsx
const getCurrentUserCompany = async () => {
  try {
    const token = localStorage.getItem('token');
    const response = await fetch('http://localhost:8000/auth/me', {
      headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
      }
    });
    if (response.ok) {
      const userData = await response.json();
      setCurrentUserCompany(userData.company || '');
    }
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Failed to get current user company:', err);
  }
};
```

### 3. Updated Company Indicator Logic
```jsx
<Chip 
  label={`Company: ${currentUserCompany || (users.length > 0 ? users[0].company : 'Loading...')}`}
  color="primary"
  variant="outlined"
  sx={{ mt: 1 }}
/>
```

### 4. Enhanced Form Initialization
```jsx
// Use current user's company with fallback to first user's company
const adminCompany = currentUserCompany || (users.length > 0 ? users[0].company : '');
setFormData({
  name: '',
  email: '',
  company: adminCompany, // Auto-set to admin's company
  password: '',
  role: 'user'
});
```

### 5. Updated useEffect
```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  getCurrentUserCompany();
  fetchUsers();
}, []);
```

## Benefits

### 1. Reliable Company Display
- Gets company directly from current user's session
- Falls back to users list if needed
- Shows "Loading..." only when truly loading

### 2. Better User Experience
- Company indicator loads faster
- More accurate company information
- Consistent behavior across different scenarios

### 3. Robust Fallback System
- Primary: Current user's company from `/auth/me` endpoint
- Secondary: First user's company from users list
- Tertiary: "Loading..." message

## Files Modified

1. `frontend/src/pages/admin/UserManagement.jsx` - Added current user company state and logic

## Testing

The fix ensures that:
1. Company indicator shows the correct company name immediately
2. No more "Loading..." for NetAegis company users
3. Form auto-populates with correct company when adding new users
4. Works reliably even with single user scenarios
