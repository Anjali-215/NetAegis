# Admin Self-Exclusion Feature Implementation

## Overview
Modified the admin user management to exclude the current admin from the user list, ensuring admins can see other admins and users from their company but not themselves.

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes

#### 1. User Service (`backend/services/user_service.py`)
- **Modified**: `list_users()` method now accepts `exclude_user_id` parameter
- **Added**: MongoDB query exclusion: `{"_id": {"$ne": ObjectId(exclude_user_id)}}`
- **Result**: Current admin is excluded from the user list

#### 2. Admin Endpoints (`backend/api/auth.py`)
- **Modified**: `GET /auth/admin/users` now passes admin's ID for exclusion
- **Result**: Admin sees all company users except themselves

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. User Management Dashboard (`frontend/src/pages/admin/UserManagement.jsx`)
- **Added**: Note indicating "You are excluded from this list"
- **Result**: Clear user feedback about self-exclusion

### Test Updates

#### 1. Test Script (`test_company_filtering.py`)
- **Added**: Verification that admin is not in their own user list
- **Added**: Checks for self-exclusion in both company scenarios
- **Result**: Comprehensive testing of the new feature

## Behavior Now

### What Admin Sees:
- ✅ Other admins from the same company
- ✅ Regular users from the same company
- ❌ Themselves (excluded)
- ❌ Users from other companies

### Example Scenario:
**Christ Company Admin (Arun M P)** will see:
- Other Christ Company admins (if any)
- All Christ Company regular users
- **Will NOT see**: Arun M P (themselves)
- **Will NOT see**: Users from other companies

## Security Benefits

1. **Cleaner Interface**: Admins don't see themselves in management lists
2. **Prevents Self-Modification**: Admins can't accidentally modify their own accounts through the admin interface
3. **Clear Scope**: Makes it obvious which users are under management
4. **Professional UX**: Standard practice in admin interfaces

## API Response Example

**Before:**
```json
[
  {"id": "1", "name": "Admin User", "email": "admin@company.com", "role": "admin"},
  {"id": "2", "name": "Regular User", "email": "user@company.com", "role": "user"}
]
```

**After (when logged in as Admin User):**
```json
[
  {"id": "2", "name": "Regular User", "email": "user@company.com", "role": "user"}
]
```

## Files Modified

1. `backend/services/user_service.py` - Added exclude_user_id parameter
2. `backend/api/auth.py` - Pass admin ID for exclusion
3. `frontend/src/pages/admin/UserManagement.jsx` - Added exclusion note
4. `test_company_filtering.py` - Added self-exclusion tests
5. `COMPANY_FILTERING_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Updated documentation

## Testing

Run the test script to verify:
```bash
python test_company_filtering.py
```

This will test:
- Company isolation (no cross-company users)
- Self-exclusion (admin not in own list)
- Proper functionality for multiple companies
