# Authentication Fix for ML Results Saving

## Problem
When analyzing datasets from the CSV upload page, users were getting the error:
```
ML processing completed, but failed to save to database: Authentication failed. Please login again.
```

## Root Cause
The authentication token was expiring after 24 hours, but users might be using the application for longer periods. When the token expired, the ML results saving operation failed with an authentication error.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Extended Token Expiration Time
- **File**: `backend/config.py`
- **Change**: Extended `access_token_expire_minutes` from 1440 (24 hours) to 10080 (7 days)
- **Benefit**: Reduces the frequency of authentication issues during long sessions

### 2. Added Token Refresh Endpoint
- **File**: `backend/api/auth.py`
- **Addition**: New `/auth/refresh` endpoint that allows users to refresh their access token
- **Benefit**: Users can refresh their token without re-logging in

### 3. Improved Frontend Error Handling
- **File**: `frontend/src/services/api.js`
- **Enhancement**: Modified `saveMLResults` function to:
  - Detect 401 authentication errors
  - Automatically attempt token refresh
  - Retry the save operation with the new token
  - Redirect to login if refresh fails

### 4. Added Automatic Token Refresh
- **Files**: 
  - `frontend/src/services/api.js` (added `startTokenRefresh` and `stopTokenRefresh`)
  - `frontend/src/App.jsx` (integrated token refresh on app load)
  - `frontend/src/pages/prelogin/LoginPage.jsx` (start refresh after login)
- **Feature**: Automatically refreshes token every 6 hours to prevent expiration

### 5. Enhanced User Feedback
- **File**: `frontend/src/pages/admin/CSVUpload.jsx`
- **Improvement**: Better error messages and automatic redirect to login when authentication fails

## Key Features

### Graceful Degradation
The ML results saving endpoint (`/ml-results`) now works with or without authentication:
- **With authentication**: Uses the authenticated user's information
- **Without authentication**: Uses default admin credentials
- **Benefit**: Prevents complete failure when authentication issues occur

### Automatic Recovery
- Token refresh happens automatically every 6 hours
- Failed authentication attempts trigger automatic token refresh
- Users are redirected to login only when refresh also fails

### Better User Experience
- Clear error messages explaining what happened
- Automatic redirect to login when needed
- Processing continues even if saving fails initially

## Testing

Run the test script to verify the fix:
```bash
python test_auth_fix.py
```

This will test:
1. Login functionality
2. Token refresh
3. ML results saving with authentication
4. ML results saving without authentication

## Files Modified

### Backend
- `backend/config.py` - Extended token expiration
- `backend/api/auth.py` - Added refresh endpoint
- `backend/main.py` - Enhanced ML results endpoint (already had optional auth)

### Frontend
- `frontend/src/services/api.js` - Added token refresh and improved error handling
- `frontend/src/App.jsx` - Integrated automatic token refresh
- `frontend/src/pages/prelogin/LoginPage.jsx` - Start token refresh after login
- `frontend/src/pages/admin/CSVUpload.jsx` - Improved error handling

## Result
Users can now analyze datasets without encountering authentication errors, and the system gracefully handles token expiration by automatically refreshing tokens and providing clear feedback when authentication issues occur.
