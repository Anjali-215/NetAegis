# File Preview Header Text Color Fix

## Problem
The file preview dialog in the admin dashboard showed white header text on a dark background, making it difficult to read. The user requested to change the header styling to have white text on a black background.

## Root Cause
The file preview dialog in `frontend/src/pages/admin/CSVUpload.jsx` had header text styled with white color on a light gray background, which didn't provide the desired contrast.

## Solution Implemented

### File Modified
**File**: `frontend/src/pages/admin/CSVUpload.jsx`

### Change Made
Changed the header styling to have white text on a black background.

**Before:**
```jsx
<Box component="tr" sx={{ backgroundColor: 'grey.100' }}>
  <Box 
    key={header} 
    component="th" 
    sx={{ 
      p: 1, 
      textAlign: 'left', 
      borderBottom: 1, 
      borderColor: 'grey.300',
      fontSize: '0.875rem',
      fontWeight: 'bold'
    }}
  >
    {header}
  </Box>
</Box>
```

**After:**
```jsx
<Box component="tr" sx={{ backgroundColor: 'black' }}>
  <Box 
    key={header} 
    component="th" 
    sx={{ 
      p: 1, 
      textAlign: 'left', 
      borderBottom: 1, 
      borderColor: 'grey.300',
      fontSize: '0.875rem',
      fontWeight: 'bold',
      color: 'white'  // Make header text white
    }}
  >
    {header}
  </Box>
</Box>
```

## Impact

### Before Fix:
- ❌ Header text was white on light gray background
- ❌ Poor contrast and visibility
- ❌ User experience was compromised

### After Fix:
- ✅ Header text is now white on black background
- ✅ High contrast and excellent visibility
- ✅ Improved readability and user experience

## Location of Fix
The fix was applied to the file preview dialog that appears when clicking the eye icon (Visibility) on uploaded CSV files in the admin dashboard.

**Dialog Location**: Lines 1153-1226 in `frontend/src/pages/admin/CSVUpload.jsx`

**Specific Change**: Line 1180 - Added `color: 'black'` to the header cell styling

## User Component Note
The user dashboard (`frontend/src/pages/user/CSVUpload.jsx`) uses Material-UI's Table component for file preview, which automatically handles proper text coloring and doesn't require this fix.

## Testing
1. Upload a CSV file in the admin dashboard
2. Click the eye icon to preview the file
3. Verify that the column headers are now black and clearly visible
4. Confirm the preview dialog displays properly with good contrast
