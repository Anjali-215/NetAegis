# Email Summary Fix - NetAegis

## Problem
The system was sending individual emails for each record during CSV processing, which resulted in too many emails being sent when processing large CSV files.

## Solution
Modified the system to send a single summary email after CSV processing is complete, instead of individual emails for each record.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Changes

#### `backend/utils/email_service.py`
- **Added**: `send_csv_processing_summary()` method
  - Sends a single, comprehensive email with processing statistics
  - Includes threat summary, processing duration, and file information
  - Beautiful HTML template with professional styling

#### `backend/main.py`
- **Added**: `BulkPredictionRequest` and `CSVSummaryRequest` models
- **Added**: `/predict-bulk` endpoint
  - Processes multiple records without sending individual emails
  - Returns results for all records in a single response
  - More efficient than individual predictions
- **Added**: `/send-csv-summary` endpoint
  - Sends summary email after CSV processing completes
  - Includes all processing statistics and threat summary

### 2. Frontend Changes

#### `frontend/src/services/api.js`
- **Added**: `predictThreatBulk()` function for bulk prediction
- **Added**: `sendCSVSummaryEmail()` function for summary emails

#### `frontend/src/pages/admin/CSVUpload.jsx`
- **Modified**: `handleProcessWithML()` function
  - Now uses bulk prediction instead of individual predictions
  - Sends summary email after processing completes
  - Updated success message to mention summary email
  - Increased batch size from 10 to 50 for better efficiency

#### `frontend/src/pages/user/CSVUpload.jsx`
- **Modified**: Processing logic to use bulk prediction
  - Same changes as admin CSVUpload
  - Updated success message to mention summary email

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Email Spam**: Only one email per CSV processing instead of hundreds
2. **Better User Experience**: Users get a comprehensive summary instead of overwhelming individual alerts
3. **Improved Performance**: Bulk processing is more efficient than individual requests
4. **Professional Appearance**: Summary email has beautiful HTML template with statistics
5. **Minimal Changes**: Existing functionality preserved, only email behavior changed

## Email Content

The summary email includes:
- File name and processing statistics
- Total records, processed records, failed records
- Processing duration
- Threat summary with counts by threat type
- Professional HTML styling
- Clear next steps for the user

## Testing

Created `test_bulk_prediction.py` to verify:
- Bulk prediction endpoint works correctly
- Summary email endpoint functions properly
- No individual emails are sent during processing

## Usage

The changes are transparent to users:
1. Upload CSV file as usual
2. Click "Process with ML" 
3. System processes all records using bulk prediction
4. Single summary email is sent upon completion
5. Results are saved to database as before

## Backward Compatibility

- Individual `/predict` endpoint still works for single record predictions
- All existing functionality preserved
- Database structure unchanged
- No breaking changes to existing APIs
