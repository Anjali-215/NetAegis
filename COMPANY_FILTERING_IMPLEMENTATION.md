# Company-Based User Filtering Implementation

## Overview
This implementation ensures that admin users can only see and manage users from their own company. This provides proper data isolation and security between different companies using the NetAegis platform.

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes

#### 1. User Service (`backend/services/user_service.py`)
- Modified `list_users()` method to accept optional `company` and `exclude_user_id` parameters
- Added company filtering to the database query when company is provided
- Added self-exclusion to prevent admins from seeing themselves in the list
- **Before**: `cursor = self.collection.find({})`
- **After**: `cursor = self.collection.find({"company": company, "_id": {"$ne": ObjectId(exclude_user_id)}})`

#### 2. Admin Endpoints (`backend/api/auth.py`)
- **List Users**: Now filters by admin's company and excludes the current admin
- **Delete User**: Added company validation before deletion
- **Update User**: Added company validation before updates
- **Reset Password**: Added company validation before password reset
- **Add User**: Forces new users to have the same company as the admin

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. User Management Dashboard (`frontend/src/pages/admin/UserManagement.jsx`)
- Added company indicator chip showing the current company
- Added note indicating that statistics are company-specific
- Users can now clearly see they're only viewing users from their company

## Security Features

### 1. Data Isolation
- Admin users can only see users from their own company
- Admin users cannot see themselves in the user list
- No cross-company data leakage possible

### 2. Operation Restrictions
- Cannot delete users from different companies
- Cannot update users from different companies
- Cannot reset passwords for users from different companies
- New users are automatically assigned to the admin's company

### 3. Automatic Company Assignment
- When admins create new users, the company is automatically set to match the admin's company
- Prevents accidental creation of users for wrong companies

## API Endpoints Affected

### Modified Endpoints:
- `GET /auth/admin/users` - Now filters by company
- `DELETE /auth/admin/users/{user_id}` - Added company validation
- `PUT /auth/admin/users/{user_id}` - Added company validation
- `POST /auth/admin/users/{user_id}/reset-password` - Added company validation
- `POST /auth/admin/add_user` - Forces company to match admin

### Error Messages:
- "Cannot delete users from different company"
- "Cannot update users from different company"
- "Cannot reset password for users from different company"

## Testing

A test script (`test_company_filtering.py`) has been created to verify:
1. Users from different companies are properly isolated
2. Admin users can only see their own company's users
3. Cross-company operations are properly blocked

## Example Usage

### Scenario: Two Companies
- **Company A**: Admin A can only see and manage Company A users (excluding themselves)
- **Company B**: Admin B can only see and manage Company B users (excluding themselves)
- **Isolation**: Admin A cannot see, edit, or delete Company B users and vice versa
- **Self-Exclusion**: Admins cannot see themselves in the user management list

### Frontend Display
- Company indicator shows "Company: [Company Name]"
- Statistics note: "* Statistics shown are for your company only"
- User list only shows users from the admin's company

## Benefits

1. **Security**: Complete data isolation between companies
2. **Compliance**: Meets multi-tenant security requirements
3. **User Experience**: Clear indication of company scope
4. **Data Integrity**: Prevents accidental cross-company operations
5. **Scalability**: Supports multiple companies on the same platform

## Future Enhancements

1. **Company Management**: Add super-admin role for managing multiple companies
2. **Audit Logging**: Track company-specific operations
3. **Advanced Filtering**: Add additional filters within company scope
4. **Bulk Operations**: Support for bulk user management within company
