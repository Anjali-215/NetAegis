# Detection Logs Company-Based Filtering Implementation

## Overview
Implemented company-based filtering for detection logs in the admin dashboard. Now admins can only see and manage detection logs from users of their own company, ensuring proper data isolation between different companies.

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes

#### 1. ML Results Models (`backend/models/ml_results.py`)
- **Added**: `company` field to `MLResultBase` and `MLResultSummary` models
- **Purpose**: Store company information for each ML result
- **Impact**: All new ML results will include company information

#### 2. Save ML Results Endpoint (`backend/main.py`)
- **Modified**: `/ml-results` POST endpoint to include company information
- **Logic**: Automatically sets company from current user's company
- **Security**: Ensures company information is always included

#### 3. Get ML Results Endpoint (`backend/main.py`)
- **Modified**: `/ml-results` GET endpoint to filter by company for admins
- **Before**: Admins could see all ML results from all companies
- **After**: Admins can only see ML results from their own company
- **Query**: `query["company"] = current_user.company` for admin users

#### 4. ML Result Detail Endpoint (`backend/main.py`)
- **Modified**: `/ml-results/{result_id}` GET endpoint to validate company access
- **Security**: Admins can only view detailed results from their company
- **Error**: "Access denied - can only view logs from your company"

#### 5. Delete ML Result Endpoint (`backend/main.py`)
- **Modified**: `/ml-results/{result_id}` DELETE endpoint to validate company access
- **Security**: Admins can only delete results from their company
- **Error**: "Access denied - can only delete logs from your company"

## Security Features

### 1. Data Isolation
- **Admin Access**: Admins can only see logs from their own company
- **User Access**: Regular users can only see their own logs
- **Cross-Company Protection**: No data leakage between companies

### 2. Company Validation
- **Save**: Company automatically set from current user
- **Read**: Company filtering applied for all queries
- **Delete**: Company validation before deletion
- **Detail**: Company validation before viewing details

### 3. Error Handling
- **Clear Messages**: Specific error messages for company access violations
- **Proper Status Codes**: 403 Forbidden for unauthorized access
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for security events

## API Endpoints Affected

### Modified Endpoints:
- `POST /ml-results` - Now includes company information
- `GET /ml-results` - Now filters by company for admins
- `GET /ml-results/{result_id}` - Now validates company access
- `DELETE /ml-results/{result_id}` - Now validates company access

### Query Changes:
**Before (Admin):**
```javascript
query = {} // Could see all results
```

**After (Admin):**
```javascript
query = {
  "company": current_user.company // Only same company results
}
```

## Database Impact

### New Field:
- **Field**: `company` in `ml_results` collection
- **Type**: String
- **Required**: Yes (for new records)
- **Default**: Current user's company

### Existing Data:
- **Legacy Records**: May not have company field
- **Fallback**: Uses "Unknown Company" for missing data
- **Migration**: Existing records will work but may show "Unknown Company"

## Frontend Impact

### Detection Logs Dashboard:
- **Filtered Results**: Only shows logs from admin's company
- **User Experience**: Cleaner, company-specific view
- **Security**: No cross-company data visible

### User Management:
- **Consistent**: Matches user management company filtering
- **Isolated**: Complete data isolation between companies

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Christ Company Admin
- **Can See**: All detection logs from Christ Company users
- **Cannot See**: Detection logs from other companies
- **Can Manage**: Only Christ Company detection logs

### Scenario 2: NetAegis Company Admin
- **Can See**: All detection logs from NetAegis Company users
- **Cannot See**: Detection logs from Christ Company or other companies
- **Can Manage**: Only NetAegis Company detection logs

### Scenario 3: Regular User
- **Can See**: Only their own detection logs
- **Cannot See**: Other users' logs (even from same company)
- **Can Manage**: Only their own detection logs

## Benefits

1. **Security**: Complete data isolation between companies
2. **Compliance**: Meets multi-tenant security requirements
3. **User Experience**: Cleaner, company-specific admin views
4. **Data Integrity**: Prevents accidental cross-company operations
5. **Scalability**: Supports multiple companies on same platform

## Testing

### Test Cases:
1. **Admin Login**: Verify only same company logs visible
2. **Cross-Company Access**: Verify cannot access other company logs
3. **User Login**: Verify only own logs visible
4. **New Log Creation**: Verify company automatically set
5. **Log Deletion**: Verify company validation works

### Verification:
- Login as different company admins
- Check detection logs show only company-specific data
- Verify no cross-company data leakage
- Test log creation, viewing, and deletion

## Files Modified

1. `backend/models/ml_results.py` - Added company field to models
2. `backend/main.py` - Updated all ML results endpoints with company filtering

## Future Enhancements

1. **Migration Script**: Add company field to existing records
2. **Audit Logging**: Track company-specific operations
3. **Advanced Filtering**: Add company filter in frontend
4. **Bulk Operations**: Support for bulk company-specific operations
